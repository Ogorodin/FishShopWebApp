# Spring web shop project

Web-shop which offers different types of products for aquarium enthusiasts. It is planned to be a multi-functional application which functionalities would make it useful not only for the everyday customer, but also for the employees (both retail and management) of the physical, real-life shop.

## Built with
* Spring Boot
* Maven

## Prerequisites
To run this application you will need:
* Java - JRE 1.8 or higher
* MySQL
* Run the script for the database model (provided in one of the packages inside the project)
* Check out the application.properties file to make sure you are all set up, or optionally change the properties file as you wish/need to run this app


## Usage

At this moment, the part of the application that is fully functional (but also still under development) is the part that is intended to be used by users logged in as 'admin'. To access the page for admins you'll have to visit the localhost/admin url which will trigger the admin view. There you can play around with the basic CRUD operations and manage the employees as you wish.
Other than that, the rest of the application will either work or be unresponsive - this will change and this 'readme' will be updated accordingly...
